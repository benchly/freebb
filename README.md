# freebb
a static blog generator inspired by bashblog

FreeBB is a very tiny static blog generator inspired by cfenollosa's bashblog. 

If you are looking for something more robust, definitely give bashblog a try:

While I absolutely love bashblog, I found that I was not using 90% of its features
or capabilities and decided to try making my own script for banging out
blog posts quickly while generating an updated index file. FreeBB is the result.

FreeBB is meant to be a quick and dirty solution, so it's not competative with 
many other static website generators. It's features are limited to:
  - Simple, customizable CSS
  - Generating initial blog structure
  - Creating new posts and updating the index file

While you can create the initial about.html and links.html from within the script,
editing them will overwrite old content. It's better to add the content with your 
favorite text editor, then leave them alone. Future iterations of this script might
just remove the menu option all together, but I will leave it in for now. 

I am not as adept with bash as I probably should be as a Citizen of the Command Line,
but I am definitely open to better ways to execute stuff.
